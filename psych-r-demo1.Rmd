```


## **Introduction**

- In this introductory class you are going to learn how to:
  >- read a .csv file into R Studio
  >- wrangle and explore the data using Tidyverse methods
  >- generate plots
  >- perform a t-test

## **Considerations**

>- Today we are skimming the surface of R's functionality
>- R has a steep learning curve relative to other high level stats packages (e.g. SPSS)
>- You are going to make mistakes - a single letter out of place will cause errors. Take your time!
>- Persistence is greatly rewarded in the long-term

# **Quick peek at the user interface**


## **Tidyverse**

>- Today we are using *Tidyverse* methods to wrangle and analyse the data
>- The Tidyverse is a set of R packages that allows for more user friendly programming, relative to what's called *base R*
>- For more about the Tidyverse see Hadley Wickham's free online text [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 
>- Our first task is to install these packages and load them to R Studio 

----

## **Tidyverse packages**

>- `readr` - for reading in data
>- `tidyr` - for tidying & wrangling data
>- `dplyr` - for tidying & wrangling data
>- `ggplot`- for plotting data


## **Main verbs of R's Tidyverse**

- These packages allow us to use Tidyverse verbs:

>- `filter`: extract rows
>- `select`: extract columns 
>- `gather/spread`: gather columns into rows/spread rows into columns
>- `mutate`: compute and append new/existing columns
>- `summarise`: summarise data based on stated criteria


----

- You are going to see a lot of this symbol

```{r piping, eval = F, echo = T}
%>%
```

- This is the *pipe* operator
- Do not fear the pipe operator
- It means is "then do this"


## Retrieving the data

- the data and code you need for today can be found here

https://github.com/petermckenna/psych-r-demo

- on this page click **Clone or download** --> **Download ZIP**

- Save the Zip folder in your user directory, e.g. `C/Users/xm42/University/Psychology coursework/R demo`. You may need to copy it from your *Downloads* folder

- Save the folder where you keep your other **research methods** materials



## Setting up a working directory pt 1

- to set up the directory locate the **psych-demo** Zip folder by...

>- Going to R Studio and clicking the **Files** tab on the right panel

>- Click the 3 dots **...** below the refresh symbol

>- Locate the Zip folder and click **OK**

>- Click the **More** option to the left of the **...** button and select **Set as Working Directory**



## Setting up a working directory pt 2

- Alternatively, enter the directory manually using the command `setwd` and quoting the file path, e.g.

`setwd("C/Users/xm42/University/Resarch methods")`

- Once complete you should see a list of files appear in the files tab (bottom right)
- That means R Studio has access to the directory

## **Start your own script**

- You are now ready to start your own script
- Scripts are edited in the *Workspace Tab* - above the R Console
- Create script headings using `#` (called a "comment"; inactive code) 
- Now your directory is set up the first task is to install and load the necessary packages


## **Installing Packages**

```{r loading packages, echo = T, eval = F, warning = F, message = F}

install.packages('readr')   # installs the 'readr' package
install.packages('tidyr')   # installs the 'tidyr' package
install.packages('dplyr')   # installs the 'dplyr' package
install.packages('ggplot2') # installs the 'ggplot2' package

```

- To execute code press `Ctrl + Enter`
- This can be done for single lines, or multiple lines by highlighting sections
- Package installation take a minute

## **Loading in the packages**

```{r loading packages pt2, echo = T, warning = F, message = F}

library(readr)   # load 'readr' package
library(tidyr)   # load 'tidyr' package
library(dplyr)   # load 'dplyr' package
library(ggplot2) # load 'ggplot2' package

```

- do not be concerned by the text generated in the console; R packages are stamped to certain versions of R Studio, but work fine once loaded


## **Reading in the data**

- We then read in the data (a .csv file) using the following code

```{r reading in the data, echo=TRUE, warning = F, message = F}

t_test_data <- read_csv("t-test-data.csv")

```

>- this syntax creates an object called `t_test_data` from an existing .csv data file 


## **Viewing the data**

- Let's have a look at the data
- Do do this you can click on the `t_test_data` object created in the *Global Environment* (panel in top right)
- We can use the `head` command to examine first 6 rows of the data as a sanity check 


---

```{r viewing the data, echo = T}

head(t_test_data)

```


## **Description of the data**

> - The data details 60 participants Likert rating and response time of animated v non-animated robot
> - The data is in the *long format* where each row represents a unique observation; in this case, one per participant
> - the experiment (or user study) is between-subjects

----

- `id` = participant number \

- `Likert_rating` = participants evaluation of the interaction from 1 (Not very friendly) to 5 (very friendly) \

- `animacy` = condition with two levels (animated, non-animated)
  - in the **animated** condition the robot tracks participant's head and uses hand gestures in communication
  - in the **non_animated** condition the robot is static \
  
- `response_time` vector = the time (seconds) it took for participants to indicate how friendly they thought the robot was on the Likert scale


## **Generating descriptve statistics** 

- To generate a summary the data we use the `summary` command

```{r summarising data, echo = T}  

summary(t_test_data)

```

- as you can see, `summary` has generated the min, max, median, and mean for our outcome vectors `likert_num` and `response_time` 



## **Generating descriptve statistics | Between group summaries: part 1**

>- We are interested in differences between the participants who interacted with the **animated** and the **non_animated** robot
>- So, we generate summaries of the outcome variables (`likert_num`, `response_time`) by group (**animated**, **non_animated**)
>- Remember, `%>%` means, "then do this"


## **Generating descriptve statistics | Between group summaries: part 2**[.small]

- The following syntax generated the mean and standard deviation for each combination of group and outcome variable 

```{r summarising by group, echo = T}

t_test_data %>%
  group_by(animacy) %>%                     
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(likert_num),  
            sd_rating = sd(likert_num),
            avg_rt = mean(response_time),
            sd_rt = sd(response_time))

```

## **Generating descriptve statistics | Between group summaries: part 3**

- As you can see, participants in the **animated** robot group rated the robot as more friendly (M = 4.13, SD = 0.86) compared to participants in the **non-animated** robot group (M = 2.77, 1.01).  
- Also, participants in the **animated** robot group took longer to respond to the Likert question on Friendliness (M = 5.06, SD = 1.06) compared to participants in the **non-animated** robot group (M = 3.46, 1.03). 


## **Checking for group (animated, non_animated) differences**


- A useful way to check the difference in scores between groups is to generate a box plot
- We use the `ggplot2` package to generate graphics
- Note, `ggplot2` uses `+` instead of `%>%` - programming can be fickle
- First we'll look at `response_time` then `likert_num`


## **Response Time(sec) between groups**

```{r checking group differences in rt with boxplot pt1, echo = T, eval = F}

t_test_data %>%
  ggplot(.) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = animacy, y = response_time, fill = animacy)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```


----

```{r checking group differences in rt with boxplot pt2, echo = F, eval = T}

t_test_data %>%
  ggplot(.) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = animacy, y = response_time, fill = animacy)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

- in a box plot the bold lines in the box show the median
- There is a big difference between the medians of the two groups and their response time (sec)

## **Rating of robot's friendliness between groups**

```{r checking group differences in likert with boxplot, echo = T}

# first, make an object (here I've called it 't') that contains the means and sd of likert_num

t <- t_test_data %>%
  group_by(animacy) %>%                     
  summarise(avg_rating = mean(likert_num),  
            sd_rating = sd(likert_num))

# then pass to ggplot2

t %>%
  ggplot(., aes(animacy, avg_rating, fill = animacy)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = avg_rating - sd_rating, ymax = avg_rating + sd_rating), width = .2)


```

## **Performing a t-test | pt 1 likert data**

>- Now we can check if our groups differ significantly in terms of how friendly they rated the robot (**likert_num**) and their response time (**response_time**)
>- We'll start with the Likert data
>- The `t.test` will calculate this difference
>- To pass data to `t.test` we need to remove `id` and `response_time` vectors to perform grouping, then add `id` again at the end

----

```{r t-test likert data, echo T }

t_test <- t_test_data %>%
  select(-id, -response_time) %>%  
  group_by_at(vars(animacy)) %>%
  mutate(id=1:n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  spread(key = animacy, value = likert_num) 

```

----

- This new object `t_test` can no be passed to the `t.test` function
- We use the `$` to specify a vector from the object, in this case, our groups

```{r t-test likert analysis, echo = T}

t.test(t_test$non_animated, t_test$animated)

```
>- Note: if want paired samples t-test add `paired=FALSE`, e.g. t.test(t_test$non_animated, t_test$animated, paired = FALSE) 


## **Interpreting the output**

- Your interested in the 3rd line of output ( the one beginning with *t*)
- t = -5.6539, df = 56.632, p-value = 5.357e-07
- So, p < 0.001.
- Convention holds that this is statistically significant
- So you can conclude that participants in the **animated** robot group rated the robot as significantly friendlier (M = 4.13, SD = 0.86) compared to participants in the **non-animated** robot group (M = 2.77, 1.01), *t* = -5.6539, df = 56.632, *p* < 0.001. 


## **Performing a t-test | pt 2 response time data**

- This time a new object called `t_test1` is created for the `response_time` data t-test

```{r t-test response time, echo = T}

t_test1 <- t_test_data %>%
  select(-id, -likert_num) %>%  
  group_by_at(vars(animacy)) %>%
  mutate(id=1:n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  spread(key = animacy, value = response_time) 


```

----

- Then we pass this data to the t.test function and interpret the findings in the same way

```{r}

t.test(t_test1$non_animated, t_test1$animated)

```
